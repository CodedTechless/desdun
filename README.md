## Versioning system
In 0.x.x, versions are quite arbitrary. Whenever a decently large change is made, the minor version is incremented. If a small but relatively impactful change is made, then the patch number is incremented. Instead of using suffixes like -alpha, -dev, or -beta, this is how pre-release versions of this software will be numbered.
