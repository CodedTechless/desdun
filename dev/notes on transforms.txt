start the step
iterate through all objects
	store the last transform and pos, rot and scale in global space
	store the last transform in local space
	run onGameStep
		if this object changes its local pos, scale or rot
			mark its information as "dirty", which means it's inaccurate and needs to be recalculated
		if this object runs a getGlobalX() function
			then calculate the global pos, scale and rot, if the current information is "dirty"
			calculate the transform as well
end the step

start the frame
iterate through all objects
	getInterpolatedTransform()
		take the last global transform and the current global transform
		interpolate them
		return the result
